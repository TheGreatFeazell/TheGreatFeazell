- 👋 Hi, I’m @TheGreatFeazell. I have been developing software for almost 40 years. For the past 20 years, I have wroked as a .Net developer (C#) doing mostly back-end business logic for a heavily transacted B2B system using XML Web Services (.Net Remoting) and ASP .Net web forms. Our enterprise platform uses TFS.
- 👀 I’m interested in learning the more contemporary patters for Azure Devops, and GIT. I am interested in .Net Core development and contirbuting to open-source projects for cross-platofrm applications. Some of my interests include mobile apps (particularly for Android, since that's my platform of choice) and GTK. I have some C++ background but it's mostly academic. I'd like to get more into LInux and GTK development, as well as exploring new technologies for web-based applications, including Docker.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Git, .Net Core, Docker, and GTK
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any interesting open-source projects using C#. I would like to contirubte to frameworks and other projects that can benefit other developers and the development community at-large.
